# Use Class/Object/Package File (Go)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future GoLang projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/golang-importclass
  cd golang-importclass
  go run main.go
  ```
*Formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
